Description(taken from r/dailyprogrammer)

Most of us have seen and ridden elevators - you crazy folks in the UK and commonwealth countries often call them "lifts" - but I'm sure I'm not the only one who has puzzled about the scheduling algorithms. Which riders do you pick up and when? Do you service requests in the order of arrival or do you work on maximal overlap?
For this challenge, you'll have to anwer those questions. You're designing an elevator scheduling algorithm for a building and you have plenty of riders to keep happy. You can have any algorithm you want as long as you stick to the constraints - the cars have a fixed capacity and speed.
Make sure you see the bonus questions after the challenge input.
